# 🎤 Taylor Swift Ticketsmaster

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Taylor Swift Ticketsmaster** project.  
This group project focuses on deploying a **scalable, cost-effective, and reliable infrastructure** for the Taylor Swift concert ticket shop.

## 🚀 Project Goal
Our mission is to provision and document the infrastructure required to host the PrestaShop-based ticket shop, ensuring it can handle massive traffic surges during ticket sales.  
Deliverables include:
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CDKTF)
- Scalable deployment (Docker + Database)
- Cost estimation based on benchmarks
- Developer-friendly documentation
- Final presentation of design choices and costs
